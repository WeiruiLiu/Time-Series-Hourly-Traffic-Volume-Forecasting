# Hourly Traffic Volume Forecasting - Time Series Analysis and Modeling
Individual Project: Rayna Liu

## Background and Introduction
Traffic volume forecasts are used by many transportation analysis and management systems to better characterize and react to fluctuating traffic patterns. Develop a couple of models to forecast the hourly traffic volume and select the best model by observing, analyzing, and comparing these modelsâ€™ residual and forecast errors.

The purpose of this term project is to find the best model to forecast the hourly traffic volume. First, do the data preprocessing to know the content of the dataset. Then, do the time series analysis to find the dataset's time-series properties, like stationarity, trend, and seasonality. Dealing with data non-stationary, strong seasonality, and strong trends if applicable. Developing multiple models such as Holt-Winter, Multiple Linear Regression, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, and based models. By analyzing their residual and forecast error, the optimal model was selected to forecast traffic volume.

## Dataset
Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Dataset is about hourly Minneapolis-St Paul, MN traffic volume for westbound 1-94. It includes weather and holiday features from 2012-2018 with link [Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume).
